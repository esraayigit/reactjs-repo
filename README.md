# React + Vite
This repository is a collection where I document my passionate journey into the world of React.js. After completing a React.js course on Udemy, I decided to showcase my own learning process and practice in this repository.

# Why React.js?
React.js is a technology that has impressed me and constantly pushes me to improve. Its ease of use, component-based architecture, the concept of virtual DOM, and extensive community support have drawn me in. This repository aims to be a resource for anyone looking to better understand, implement, and use React.js in their projects.

# Code Exercises:
Contains small daily coding exercises. These exercises help me reinforce and better understand React.js concepts.

# Project Applications: 
Includes projects developed within the scope of the course and projects I plan to further enhance. These projects are a reflection of my hands-on learning process with React.js.

# Notes and Resources: 
Includes notes I've taken to better understand what I've learned and share with others. Additionally, I'll share useful resources related to React.js.

This repository serves as both a journal for me and a resource for anyone else on their journey of learning React.js. If you share an interest in this technology, feel free to join me in this repository for your learning journey. We are here to learn, grow, and code together!
